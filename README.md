# BD-temperature-prediction
As a result of global warming, there is a significant change in our climate. There are several reasons for global warming and as a result of global warming there are changes in different aspects of nature. In this finding, we considered CO2 emission as a potential reason for global warming, we considered solar radiation and rainfall as potential reasons for climate change and we considered temperature as a candidate of climate change indicator. In this case, the scope can be very large. So, we considered the temperature in Dhaka - which we wanted to predict. For  predicting the temperature (target variable) of Bangladesh from feature variables - Bangladesh CO2 emission, global CO2 emission, solar radiation and rainfall data of Bangladesh.
